## Error when installing and running

### Before running, about tokens
Copy `.env.example` file into a new file `.env`.

### Error when npm install better-sqlite3
If the command line shows something like "TLS error", try to set the environment variable NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED to 0: 
`set NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`.

### "Sharp" error
The command line shows `Something went wrong installing the "sharp" module`. 
Possible solutions: if you use Windows, try to install Visual Studio build tools. See this [link](https://forum.strapi.io/t/facing-error-on-installation-of-strapi-something-went-wrong-installing-the-sharp-module/16420).
